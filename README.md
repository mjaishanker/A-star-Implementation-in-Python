# A-star-Implementation-in-Python
A small project to try out A-star in the Python Environment

* To run the program use mini conda to run simulator file using "python astar.py"
* To change each senario of different cost values, change the values in the cost list in astar.py
* Ran high cost for right turn and high cost for left turn for both astar and dijkstra's algorithm
* To change between running astar and dijkstra's, enter 0 for astar and 1 for dijkstar'swhen the program runs
* The output will display the grid of the acutal path and the Expanded (closed set) nodes, the path taken along with the cost.
* All the possible outputs are in the pdf file attached with the folder
